## Real Time Bus Tracker üë®‚Äçüíª
<img src='./bostonbus.jpg'>

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. 

The goal of this exercise is to fetch data from an API and use it to animate a map.

I implemented a function to update MBTA Route 1 buses geolocation in real time every 15 seconds, and I attached to them their own markers with the bus number to identify them. I added the buses' geolocation to an array and create markers with their positions. I also wrote a function to get rid of previous markers.

## How to use üîß

To install this proyect in your machine, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the project
2. Go to content folder and add it to your code editor tool
3. Go to MapBox and get an API Token, in mapanimation.js fille, replace mapboxgl.accessToken = "THIS VALUE"; with your own API token
4. Open index.html

## Usage üöÄ

- Once map is loaded, every 15 seconds the buses will be visible in it current location so you can see where it is and where it is going to.
